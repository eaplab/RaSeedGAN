# **RAndomly-SEEDed super-resolution GAN (RaSeedGAN)**

This repository covers the Python implementation of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for estimating high-resolution field quantities from random sparse sensors without needing any full-resolution field for training.

Four different cases are available:

*   Fluidic Pinball: direct-numerical simulation (DNS) data generated from *Deng et al. (2020)*.
*   Turbulent Channel Flow: DNS data from a turbulent channel flow with friction Reynolds number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Re_{\tau}=1000"> available at [Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database](http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu).
*   Turbulent Boundary Layer Flow: experimental data of a turbulent boundary layer with friction Reynolds number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Re_{\tau}\approx 1000"> acquired in the water-tunnel facility at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
*   Sea Surface Temperature: experimental data of the global sea surface temperature from January 2000 to December 2019, downloaded from [NOAA](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/).

## **Installation**

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**

To generate the tfrecord files, execute:

```console
python run_generate_tfrecords.py -c pinball -u 4 -n 010
```

To run the training procedure, execute:

```console
python run_training --case pinball --upsampling 4 --model_name architecture01-noise-010 --noise 10 --learning_rate 1e-4
```

To compute the prediction of the testing dataset, execute:

```console
python run_predictions -c pinball -u 4 -m architecture01-noise-010 -n 10 -l 1e-4
```
